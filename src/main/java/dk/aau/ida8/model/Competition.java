/**
 * This class represents one weightlifting competition.
 *
 * Each competition is hosted by a particular weightlifting club at a venue of
 * the club's choosing, and on a set competitionDate.
 *
 * There are essentially five stages to a competition:-
 *
 * <ol>
 *     <li>Creation & open for sign-up;</li>
 *     <li>Closed for sign-up, awaiting competition competitionDate;</li>
 *     <li>The weigh-in;</li>
 *     <li>The tournament itself; and</li>
 *     <li>Announcement of results.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * The stage of a competition is dependent on the values contained within it.
 * A competition is at the first stage after creation and until after the
 * {@link #lastRegistrationDate} is reached. It is at stage two after that
 * date and before the {@link #competitionDate} has been reached.
 *
 * It is at stage three on the day of the competition. At this point, it is
 * possible to {@link Participant#setWeighedIn(boolean) check-in} participants
 * to the competition. Once weight-in ends, the user will
 * {@link #finishWeighIn() finish weight-in} and the tournament can begin.
 *
 * The tournament proceeds by registering lifts by lifters. Once this is
 * complete, the results can be announced.
 *
 * The way in which a weightlifting competition is scored varies depending on
 * the scoring rules adopted. The participants, after weigh-in, are allocated
 * to groups for competing and ranking purposes. The competition proceeds by
 * having each competing group carry-out all of their lifts in turn, until all
 * participants have completed their lifts.
 *
 * The ranking groups are then used to determine the winners within each
 * particular division of the competition. For example, in a Sinclair
 * competition, participants are divided into two groups based on gender. Then,
 * the winners are announced for each of these gender groups. In a total weight
 * competition, participants are divided into multiple groups based on both
 * gender and weight class. Winners are announced for each of these
 * weight/gender groupings.
 *
 * After a competition is created, weightlifters sign-up to participate, with
 * each lifter's participation encapsulated and stored within a
 * {@link Participant Participant} instance.
