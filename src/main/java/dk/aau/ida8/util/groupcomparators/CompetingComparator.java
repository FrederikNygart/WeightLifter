     * Compares two participants based on a number of comparison
     * factors.
     *
     * The participants are compared on the following factors, in the following
     * order:-
     *
     * <ol>
     *     <li>Completion of all lifts;</li>
     *     <li>Next weight to be lifted;</li>
     *     <li>Number of completed attempts;</li>
     *     <li>Timestamp of the first snatch / clean & jerk lift; and</li>
     *     <li>The start numbers of the participants.</li>
     * </ol>
     *
     * As soon as one factor indicates a distinction between participants, this
     * is the relevant comparison and its value will be returned. For example,
     * if both lifters have completed two lifts, then the next weight of their
     * lifts will be considered, with lowest first. If they are the same, then
     * the number of completed attempts will be compared, again with lowest
     * going first. Then, if these are the same, timestamps of the first snatch
     * or clean & jerk lifts will be compared. If these are the same (this
     * should not be possible, but it is included for completeness) then start
     * numbers are compared.

     * @param p2 The second participant to compare
     * @return a negative value where p1 comes first, positive where
     *         p2 comes first, and zero where they are equal
