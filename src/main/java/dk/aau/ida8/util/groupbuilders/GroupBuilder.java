/**
 * This abstract class defines a GroupBuilder. It is inherited by classes
 * which build groups for the purpose of competitions.
 *
 * The purpose of this builder is to generate groupings for ranking purposes,
 * and for competing purposes, within a competition. Ranking groups are used
 * to determine the placement of competitors in the results table at the end
 * of the competition. Different competitions will require different ranking
 * groups to be created depending on their rules.
 *
 * Competing groups are used to determine the order and sequence in which
 * participants compete within a competition. The interface defines a default
 * method in which the competing groups are based on breaking-down the ranking
 * groups into sub-groups of up to 10 participants. This can be overridden by
 * implementing classes.
 *
 * The GroupBuilder requires that inheriting classes implement five methods:
 *
 * <ol>
 *     <li>{@link #getRankingGrouper()};</li>
 *     <li>{@link #getRankingComparatorType()};</li>
 *     <li>{@link #getRankingGroupComparator()};</li>
 *     <li>{@link #getCompetingGroupComparator()}; and</li>
 *     <li>{@link #getCompetingGroupMaxSize()}.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * The first three relate to the (default) method by which ranking groups
 * are created. See {@link #createRankingGroups()} for details.
 *
 * The fourth relstes to how competing groups are sorted after creation. See
 * {@link #createCompetingGroups()} for details.
 *
 * The last method sets the maximum size for a competing group. These groups
 * will be no larger than this size.
 *
 * This abstract class provides a declarative way to define group builders.
 * The way in which groups are built is provided by the
 * {@link #createRankingGroups()} and {@link #createCompetingGroups()} methods
 * which use the four abstract methods described above. Thus, overriding the
 * four abstract methods will declare how groups are to be formed.
 *
 * An inheriting class can override the {@link #createRankingGroups()} and
 * {@link #createCompetingGroups()} methods, however the default implementation
 * provides a good basis for creating new concrete builders.
